# Okanagan Roam — AI Handoff

This file is the shared coordination point for AI assistants working on this repository.

## Rules

1. GitHub is the source of truth. Always inspect the current repository state before acting.
2. Do not overwrite another assistant's work. Review recent commits and existing changes first.
3. Prefer small, auditable changes with clear commit messages.
4. Never commit secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys, or private credentials.
5. For production/data changes, verify before and after and record the result here.
6. If an action is blocked, document the exact blocker rather than using an unsafe workaround.

## Current Status

* Repository: `okanaganroam/okanaganroam`
* Default branch: `main`
* Shared AI handoff file established: September 8, 2026
* Recent work includes venue enrichment, guarded corrections, duplicate/redirect infrastructure, and enrichment audit tables.
* Known baseline: 1,069 total venues, 1,052 active, 17 redirects, 900 complete, 152 missing.

## Authentication / Admin API Notes

* `ENRICHMENT_ADMIN_TOKEN` is read from the Railway environment and is not hardcoded in source.
* Admin mutation routes use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
* Missing configuration returns 503; invalid/missing bearer token returns 401.
* Token comparison uses a timing-safe comparison.
* Admin correction/enrichment routes are narrowly scoped and validate request fields before database writes.
* Never record or commit the actual admin token here.

## Latest AI Handoff

### Claude

* Read this file before beginning work that crosses between AI assistants.

### ChatGPT

* Review the latest commits and repository state before proposing or making changes.
* Use this file to leave concise coordination notes when a task crosses between assistants.
* Do not overwrite Claude's work; inspect the current GitHub state first.
* Current GitHub integration status: ChatGPT can inspect the repository but its write attempts currently return HTTP 403 (`Resource not accessible by integration`).

## Open Tasks

Add concrete tasks here when an assistant needs another assistant to continue work. Mark completed tasks with the date and commit SHA.
