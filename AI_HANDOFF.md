# Okanagan Roam — AI Handoff

This file is the shared coordination point for AI assistants working on this repository.

## Rules

1. GitHub is the source of truth. Always inspect the current repository state before acting.
2. Do not overwrite another assistant's work. Review recent commits and existing changes first.
3. Prefer small, auditable changes with clear commit messages.
4. Never commit secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys, or private credentials.
5. For production/data changes, verify before and after and record the result here.
6. If an action is blocked, document the exact blocker rather than using an unsafe workaround.

## Current Status

* Repository: `okanaganroam/okanaganroam`
* Default branch: `main`
* Shared AI handoff file established: September 8, 2026
* Recent work includes venue enrichment, guarded corrections, duplicate/redirect infrastructure, and enrichment audit tables.
* Known baseline (2026-09-08): 1,069 total venues, 1,052 active, 17 redirects, 911 complete, 141 missing.
* Updated baseline (2026-09-15, verified live against production `/api/venues`): 1,055 active venues, 989 complete (address+lat+lng all present), 66 missing (all three fields missing together in every case — no partial records). Total-including-redirects and redirect count were not reverified this pass (no admin access this session); only the active/complete/missing figures above were independently confirmed.

## Authentication / Admin API Notes

* `ENRICHMENT_ADMIN_TOKEN` is read from the Railway environment and is not hardcoded in source.
* Admin mutation routes use `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
* Missing configuration returns 503; invalid/missing bearer token returns 401.
* Token comparison uses a timing-safe comparison.
* Admin correction/enrichment routes are narrowly scoped and validate request fields before database writes.
* Never record or commit the actual admin token here.

## Latest AI Handoff

### Claude

* Continue recording meaningful production/data work in commits with descriptive messages.
* Before changing production-sensitive code or data, reconcile against the current GitHub state.
* Read this file before beginning work that crosses between AI assistants.
* Claude has confirmed the shared handoff file and is ready to coordinate through GitHub with ChatGPT.
* 2026-09-08 — Claude executed the ready 11-venue HIGH-confidence location enrichment batch (IDs: 469, 841, 857, 863, 907, 918, 967, 1000, 1002, 1004, 1041). All 11 were freshly re-verified (not assumed from prior research) via exact phone match to a single unambiguous Google listing before any write. All 11 writes succeeded with zero collateral field changes and zero anomalies. Complete-location count rose from 900 to 911; missing-location count fell from 152 to 141. Active count (1,052), redirect count (17), and all 17 existing redirect mappings were confirmed unchanged. Sitemap remained at 1,240 (expected — pure enrichment of already-active venues does not add/remove sitemap pages). The manifest file was intentionally left byte-for-byte unchanged, since manifest synchronization is a separate, not-yet-authorized task.
* 2026-09-15 — Claude re-checked current missing-location count directly against live production (`GET https://okanaganroam.com/api/venues?limit=2000`, no admin access needed since address/latitude/longitude are public fields). Active venue count is now 1,055 (up from 1,052 on 2026-09-08 — some venues were likely added between sessions). Of those, 989 have complete address+lat+lng and 66 are missing all three (down from 141 missing on 2026-09-08, indicating substantial enrichment progress happened since that note was last updated, though it wasn't logged here at the time). Redirect count and grand total (including redirects) were not reverified this pass. Note: an initial check via a summarizing web-fetch tool undercounted this (reported only 2 missing) because it truncated/summarized the ~1,055-row JSON response before counting — the 66 figure above comes from downloading the full response and counting programmatically, and should be treated as the reliable one.
### ChatGPT

* Review the latest commits and repository state before proposing or making changes.
* Use this file to leave concise coordination notes when a task crosses between assistants.
* Do not overwrite Claude's work; inspect the current GitHub state first.
* Current GitHub integration status: ChatGPT can inspect the repository but its write attempts currently return HTTP 403 (`Resource not accessible by integration`).

## Open Tasks

* **Task: Continue HIGH-confidence location enrichment for the remaining 66 active venues missing address/latitude/longitude (updated 2026-09-15; was 141 as of 2026-09-08).**

* **Why highest priority:** Location data completeness remains the largest remaining gap in the dataset — 66 of 1,055 active venues (~6%) still lack address/lat/lng, down from 141 (13%) on 2026-09-08. Substantial enrichment progress has evidently happened since that note was last updated, but it was not logged in this file at the time — whoever did that work should backfill a Change Log entry here if they see this.
* **Current evidence:** 989 of 1,055 active venues (~94%) now have complete address+lat+lng; 66 remain missing (verified live via `GET /api/venues?limit=2000`, all three fields missing together in every case). The prior candidate-tier breakdown (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence lists from the 2026-09-08 research pass) has not been re-derived against the current 66 — it should be treated as stale until someone re-identifies which of the 66 fall into which confidence tier. ID 185 (Dosa Crepe Cafe) remains flagged separately: its stored phone belongs to the Rutland (Kelowna) branch of a multi-location chain, not the Osoyoos location the record represents — it needs a combined phone correction + enrichment, not enrichment alone. (Not yet reconfirmed whether ID 185 is still one of the 66 or was already resolved.)
* **Suggested next phase:** Pull the current list of 66 venue IDs/names missing location data, re-triage them into HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence tiers (the same conservative process as before: fresh identity verification immediately before every write, exact phone match preferred, exclusion of any mobile/closed/ambiguous business, individual post-write verification, full redirect/sitemap reconciliation after each batch), and work down from HIGH confidence. A separate manifest-refresh pass should also be scheduled to bring the manifest's recorded totals back in sync with live production state.

## Change Log

* 2026-09-08 — Initial shared AI handoff file created to establish coordination between Claude and ChatGPT.
* 2026-09-08 — Claude confirmed the shared AI handoff workflow is ready.
* 2026-09-08 — Claude reviewed current repository/production state and identified continued location enrichment (152 active venues missing address/lat/lng) as the highest-priority next task; added details and a suggested approach under Open Tasks.
* 2026-09-08 — Claude executed the ready 11-venue enrichment batch (IDs 469, 841, 857, 863, 907, 918, 967, 1000, 1002, 1004, 1041). All 11 succeeded with zero anomalies. Complete-location count: 900 → 911. Missing-location count: 152 → 141. Active/redirect counts and all 17 redirects confirmed unchanged. Manifest intentionally left unchanged (separate task).
